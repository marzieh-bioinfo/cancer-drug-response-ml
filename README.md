# Cancer Drug Response ML

This project is about **predicting how cancer cells respond to drugs** using **gene expression data** and **machine learning**.

## What I want to do

- Use a real public dataset (gene expression + drug response).
- Clean and explore the data (EDA).
- Train machine learning models to predict drug sensitivity.
- Evaluate the models and see which features (genes) are important.

## Tools

- Python
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn

This project shows my skills in **bioinformatics, data analysis and machine learning** on real biological data.
